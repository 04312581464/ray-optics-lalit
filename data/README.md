- `data/galleryList.json` contains the categories and order of scenes in the gallery page, and the contributor name for each scene.
- `data/modules` contains the module json files for the modules page.
- `data/modulesList.json` contains the categories and order of modules in the modules page, and the contributor name for each module.

The `githubEmail` field is the email addresses for git commit recognized by GitHub, and the `firstCommit` is the date of the first commit associated with the contributor's contribution (not necessary by the contributor).
