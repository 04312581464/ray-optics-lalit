# Module
The "module" is a new experimental feature that allows you to combine several objects (optical elements, etc.) into a single reusable "module object" with custom parameters and control points. The objects within a module are defined with a template, which allows math equations and the creation of arrays of objects.

This folder contains public modules similar to the "gallery" folder for public scenes, and the items appear in the Tools -> Other -> Import Module dialog. To contribute a module, please add the JSON scene in this folder containing the module, an instance of the module and possibly some auxiliary objects in the scene to make the thumbnail. Add the description and specifications of the module in the `data.json` file. Do not include descriptions in the JSON scene file.

See https://github.com/ricktu288/ray-optics/discussions/145 for the announcement.
