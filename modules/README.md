# Module
The "module" is a new experimental feature that allows you to combine several objects (optical elements, etc.) into a single reusable "module object" with custom parameters and control points. The objects within a module are defined with a template, which allows math equations and the creation of arrays of objects.

See https://github.com/ricktu288/ray-optics/discussions/145 for the announcement.
